> "Belated sunshine cannot save withered flowers, bid farewell to me..."

This application aims to provide a safe space for those who need an emotional outlet. Some words can only be said to oneself, and some emotions need time to digest. The dove and the crow represent hope and melancholy, light and darkness - they are all part of life.
